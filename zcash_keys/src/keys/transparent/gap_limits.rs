/// Configuration for gap limits used in transparent address management.
///
/// A "gap limit" is the number of consecutive unused addresses that the wallet will generate
/// before stopping. This concept comes from BIP-44 HD wallet standards: when scanning for
/// funds, the wallet generates addresses sequentially and stops when it encounters a "gap"
/// of unused addresses equal to this limit. In recovery, a wallet will discover funds
/// belonging to generated addresses. Note that order of operations matters; if a wallet scans
/// blocks for transparent outputs instead of querying the UTXO set, out-of-order scanning may
/// result in funds not being found; as a result, wallets should still fall back to making
/// temporally unlinkable, private queries to the UTXO set for each address controlled by the
/// wallet at any time that a gap in scanned blocks is introduced by out-of-order scanning.
///
/// In Zcash, we define individual gap limits for the following address types:
/// - **External addresses**: Addresses shared with external parties.
/// - **Internal (change) addresses**: Used for transparent change outputs.
/// - **Ephemeral addresses**: Used for single-use purposes like ZIP-320 TEX address transfers.

/// The default gap limits supported by this implementation are:
///
/// - external addresses: 10
/// - transparent internal (change) addresses: 5
/// - ephemeral addresses: 10

/// These limits are chosen with the following rationale:
/// - At present, many wallets query light wallet servers with a set of addresses, because querying
///   for each address independently and in a fashion that is not susceptible to clustering via
///   timing correlation leads to undesirable delays in discovery of received funds. As such, it is
///   desirable to minimize the number of addresses that can be "linked", i.e. understood by the
///   light wallet server to all belong to the same wallet.
/// - For transparent change addresses it is always expected that an address will receive funds
///   immediately following its generation except in the case of wallet failure.
/// - For externally-scoped transparent addresses and ephemeral addresses, it is desirable to use a
///   slightly larger gap limit to account for addresses that were shared with counterparties never
///   having been used. However, we don't want to use the full 20-address gap limit space because
///   it's possible that in the future, changes to the light wallet protocol will obviate the need to
///   query for UTXOs in a fashion that links those addresses to one another. In such a
///   circumstance, the gap limit will be adjusted upward and address rotation should then choose
///   an address that is outside the current gap limit; after that change, newly generated
///   addresses will not be exposed as linked in the view of the light wallet server.
